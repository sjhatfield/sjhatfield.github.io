My name is Sam Hatfield and I am a Brit living in Manila, Philippines. I am a mathematician in the process of transitioning into a Data Science, Machine Learning, AI career. Resume #TODO.

My academic background is mathematics. In my studies I went deep into the purest forms of mathematics such as topology, manifolds, lie algebras, continuum mechanics, group theory and more. I worked as a mathematics teacher in two International Schools since leaving academia.

Currently, I am taking a break from work to study full-time. Most of my time has been spent completing a Masters of Science in Analytics with Georgia Tech, [details of the degree can be read here](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics/curriculum). I have completed eight courses so far (out of eleven), taking classes from the Institute of Systems Engineering, the School of Computation Science and Engineering, the Scheller College of Business and the School of Computer Science.

Now that I am getting to the end of my masters, I am transitioning my focus to building applications using the plethora of machine learning, AI, statistial and mathematical concepts I have learnt. You can read about them on this site!
