My name is Sam Hatfield and I am a Brit living in Manila, Philippines. I am a mathematician in the process of transitioning into a Data Science, Machine Learning, AI career. Check out my resume here #TODO.

 My academic background is mathematics. In my studies I went deep into the purest forms of mathematics such as topology, manifolds, lie algebras, continuum mechanics, group theory and more. I worked as a mathematics teacher in two International Schools since leaving academia.

Currently, I am taking a break from work to study full-time. Most of my time has been spent completing a Masters of Science in Analytics with Georgia Tech, [details of the degree can be read here](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics/curriculum). I have completed eight courses so far (out of eleven), taking classes from the Institute of Systems Engineering, the School of Computation Science and Engineering, the Scheller College of Business and the School of Computer Science. Here is a list of the courses I have completed with links where available: [High-Dimensional Data Analytics](https://omscs.gatech.edu/isye-8803-topics-high-dimensional-data-analytics), [Reinforcement Learning](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7642-reinforcement-learning), [Simulation](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sman/courses/6644/), [Bayesian Statistics](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~brani/isye6420/), Computational Data Analysis, Business Fundamentals for Analytics, Computing for Data Analysis and Introduction to Analytics Modeling.

Now that I am getting to the end of my Masters, I am changing my focus to building applications using what I have learnt!
