My name is Sam Hatfield and I am a Brit living in Manila, Philippines. My interests include Data Science, statistics, mathematics, programming and football (soccer).

# My Background

My academic background is mathematics which I have a Masters degree in. In my studies I went deep into the purest forms of mathematics such as topology, manifolds, lie algebras, continuum mechanics, group theory and more. At the end of my degree, I still loved mathematics and wanted to live somewhere outside of my home country of Great Britain. Hence, I became a mathematics teacher with the plan to move abroad.

# My Previous Career

After one year learning to be a teacher in London I took a position teaching at a British School in Mexico. I absolutely LOVE Mexico. The food, the people, the sights, the beaches, the nature, ... I can go on and on. After two fun years in Mexico I moved to Manila, Philippines to teach mathematics in another International School. I taught here for four years.

# The Change

I've always been passionate about learning and am always learning something new. Two years ago I decided to learn how to code. All I had learnt in my time at university was a bit of Matlab. Over the past two years I have studyied various Computer Science topics and various programming languages. I have come to the conclusion that the topics of Data Science combine my passion for mathematics, with the fun of coding and the satisfaction of getting results to real-world problems.

# The Now

I am in the process of studying Data Science to make a career change. I have one year studying Data Science full time with a plan to apply for jobs in the summer of 2020. In this blog I will be writing about what I have learnt and presenting personal Data Science projects applying what I have learnt to problems I have identified.
