I studied pure mathematics at undergrad and postgrad level and have taight High School mathematics for 6 years now. In that time I have lived in Mexico and the Philippines. I have been studying Computer Science topics for 2 years now and have decided Data Science is the topic I am most passionate about. It combines rigorous mathematics, programming and the ability to solve real-world interesting problems to be the perfect fit for me. On this website I will post articles about what I have learnt in Data Science.
