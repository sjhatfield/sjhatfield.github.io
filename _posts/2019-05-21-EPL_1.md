# The Problem

I am a passionate football (soccer[^1]) player and a semi-passionate football viewer. Whilst I do enjoy watching football games with friends, many times that I watch a football game at home to relax I get bored or distracted. Whilst I love playing football, I only find some games enjoyable to watch. Usually, I try to hedge my bets with football viewing and watch the two most highly placed teams in the Premier League (EPL) table on the date of the fixture. However, I have lost count of the number of times I have stayed awake past my bedtime to watch two highly regarded teams play a boring 0-0 draw. So, the ideal outcome for this project is:

**Given the list of fixtures taking place during the weekend and the current form of all the teams in the league, predict which will be the most likely to be an exciting game to watch**

Games will be classified as exciting if:

1. There are 4 goals scored in the game.
2. There are 3 goals scored in the game *and* there are goals scored in both halves.
3. There are 2 goals scored in the game *and*
    * the home or away team had 12 or more shots on target *or*
    * the home or away team got 6 or more yellow cards.

These criteria are based on my personal preference. In my opinion, games with goals are exciting. Games with shots on target are also exciting because it means that goal scoring chances are being created and at least one team is attacking a lot. If there are lots of yellow cards in a game it means that the game is fiesty and may be a rivalry which are often exciting games.

# The Ideal Outcome

The ideal output of this project will be a page on this blog which tells the user without having them enter any data what upcoming game is the most likely to be worth watching. If my this model can predict with over 50% accuracy an exciting game to watch then I will consider it a success. I feel at the moment that I predict the exciting games to watch about 20% of the time. Why so low a prediction you may be thinking. Well we are effectively trying to predict the outcome of a sporting event which has a lot of random chance involved.

# The Model

Let's now formulate this problem as a machine learning (ML) problem. This problem can be viewed either as a classification or regression problem. I am going to begin by treating it as a classification problem. This will prove not to be too successful and I think I will treat it as a regression problem also in a later post. The ML problem at hand is: given past EPL game data which have been classified as worth watching or not (a binary classifier) and a game set to take place in the near future with the teams current performance in the league, predict the classification (worth watching or not) of the game. I am going to first use k-Nearest Neighbors to classify upcoming games.

# Data Collection and Analysis

First we must collect data, clean it and perform some basic analysis. This [website](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php) provides csv files of each EPL season going back all the way to 1993-94. **I have used the seasons from 2000-01 onwards.**. The full jupyter notebook with all the data loading, cleaning, analysis and wrangling can be [viewed here](https://github.com/sjhatfield/worthwatching/blob/master/EPL_Wrangling_Analysis.ipynb) on my GitHub account. I will just present the findings on this page.

The dataset contains statistics for over 6000 EPL games. The statistics provided aside from teams, date, referee and so on, are related to goals, corners, fouls, cards and then betting odds. Some interesting facts found from the dataset are:

* The top scoring teams in the EPL are in order: Man Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City. The only semi-surprise here is Man City as they have only performed well in the EPL relatively recently.
* The lowest scoring teams are: Huddersfield, Bradford, Derby, Cardiff and Sheffield Utd. Derby stick out here as they have taken part in more seasons than the others.
* The teams that have been relagated and promoted the most in order are: West Brom, Birmingham, Hull, Norwich, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Sunderland.
* There is only one team that score less on average at home than away: Coventry. This is a surprising statistic although they have had issues with their home stadium.
* The highest scoring win away from home was by Tottenham against Hull in the 2016-17 season.

We can see the advantage of playing at home on goals scored in the histogram below:

We can also see an increase in the average number of goals being scored per game over the years.

# Preparing the Data for the Model

The criteria for determining whether a game was worth watching was written as a function and then applied to each row in the dataframe to create a new column, *'watch'*. If this column has 1 as an entry the game is worth watching, otherwise it has a 0.

```python
def worth_watching(row):
    goals = (row['FTHG'] + row['FTAG'] >= 4)
    both_halves = (row['FTHG'] + row['FTAG'] == 3) and (0 < row['HTHG'] + row['HTAG'] <= 2)
    shots = (row['HST'] >= 12 or row['AST'] >= 12)
    yellows = (row['HY'] >= 6 or row['AY'] >= 6)
    two_goals = (row['FTHG'] + row['FTAG'] == 2) and (shots or yellows)
    return goals or both_halves or two_goals

df['watch'] = df.apply(lambda r: 1 if worth_watching(r) else 0, axis=1)
```
