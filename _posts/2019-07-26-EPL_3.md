## A Reminder of The Stage We Are At

The problem at hand is to predict whether English Premier League games will be exciting to watch before they have taken place. The data that is being used to predict this is goals (for and against), yellow cards and shots on target, from the games that have taken place in the season already. The end goal is to be able to tell the user (aka me) which game in the coming weekend of football is the most likely to be exciting to watch.

## Generating Another Variable

Previously, we have only used previous game statistics such as goals scored, yellow cards etc to predict whether future games between two teams will be worth watching. The models used have performed slightly better than random guessing. It is clear that I need to try something else. In the original dataset betting odds were also included so I am going to try using those also. These will be available before a game takes place so may be used for prediction.

I am also going to try using the placement in the Premiership League table. A team's placement in the Premiership League table is determined by the number of points they have. I was able to use all previous fixtures from the current season to populate a dictionary of point values for each team. Then I added two columns to the data, `HP` (home points) and `AP` (away points). You can see how I did this by checking out the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sjhatfield/worthwatching/blob/master/Team_Points.ipynb).
